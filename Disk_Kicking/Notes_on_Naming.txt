The basis convention for naming is as follows,

	littleSigma_(100*littleSigma)

Once in the files we have several files,
	
	Kalnajs_angHarmonic.out - Kalnaj kernel of give angular harmonic

	Perturbation_radiusOfPertTimes100_angHarmonic.out - The perturbation to be fed into the volterra solver.

	Density_radiusOfPertTimes100_angHarmonic.csv - The density reconstuction from the volterra solver. The first line is the values of radius.
